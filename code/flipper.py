# You are given a permutation p of length n.
#
# A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, while {1,2,2} is not (since 2 appears twice), and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (as n=3, but the array contains 4).
#
# To the permutation p, you need to apply the following operation exactly once:
#
# First you choose a segment [l,r] (1≤l≤r≤n, a segment is a continuous sequence of numbers {pl,pl+1,…,pr−1,pr}) and reverse it. Reversing a segment means swapping pairs of numbers (pl,pr), (pl+1,pr−1), ..., (pl+i,pr−i) (where l+i≤r−i).
# Then you swap the prefix and suffix: [r+1,n] and [1,l−1] (note that these segments may be empty).
# For example, given n=5,p={2,3,1,5,4}, if you choose the segment [l=2,r=3], after reversing the segment p={2,1,3,5,4}, then you swap the segments [4,5] and [1,1]. Thus, p={5,4,1,3,2}. It can be shown that this is the maximum possible result for the given permutation.
#
# You need to output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained by applying the operation described exactly once.
#
# A permutation a is lexicographically greater than permutation b if there exists an i (1≤i≤n) such that aj=bj for 1≤j<i and ai>bi.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
#
# Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.
#
# The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2000) — the size of the permutation.
#
# The second line of each test case contains n integers: p1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤n) — the permutation p itself.
#
# It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2000.
#
# Output
# For each test case, output in a separate line the lexicographically maximum permutation of length n that can be obtained from p by applying the operation described in the problem exactly once.
